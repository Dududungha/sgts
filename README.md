Summer Game Type Shit

## Initial Setup
1. Make sure you have git installed. I like to use [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) because that makes git easy.
2. Install [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download), and install Unity Version 2022.3.34f1. This is the latest Unity LTS (Long Term Support) version.
3. Clone this repository onto your computer using Github Desktop.
4. Then go to Unity Hub and on the projects page, add the cloned folder as a project.
5. Open it up and you're ready to work on the game!

## Using Git with Unity
1. If you want to merge a branch, be very sure of what changes in the scene and if it is important. It is very hard to merge the scene and if one version overrides another, we will have to do extra work :(.
2. Large files like models can potentially cause an issue. Keep it under 2GB and we should be okay. If we have files bigger than 2GB then we can use a Google Drive.
3. Otherwise it is basically the same as any other application that you use git with.
